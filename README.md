#House-Cleaning-Mobile-Application

This is a school project for a subject named Mobile Application Development.
Android studio and Java was taught and used to develop this application.
This project was handled by 3 people and I am a part of the programmer for it.
A database was developed using sqlite by my former teammate and it has been modified to the current version.

!! This application is not stable and is still under progress !!

Anyone is welcomed to test out the app to give feedbacks on what could be improved and what should be induced.
